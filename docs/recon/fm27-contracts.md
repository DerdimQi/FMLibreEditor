# FM27: contract clauses, squad statuses and kinds of contract

What a player's contract holds besides the fields in `[contract]` (`profiles/fm27/layout.toml`): the kinds of its
clauses and bonuses, its squad status and its kind, by the codes the game keeps them as. Read on the Windows Steam build
26340721 (27.0.0) against the game's contract screen in English, on two saves: one of 35,867 players and one of
125,533 with many nations (15,155 of them women). From the findings in #81. The editor names every code below; the
names stay the game's English ones in the English dictionary.

## Clauses and bonuses

The contract's list at `+0x68` holds 8-byte entries: a `u32` amount in pounds (`0xFFFFFFFF` for none), a `u16`
condition (`0xFFFF` for none) and a `u16` kind.

- **A release clause's expiry** is its condition: the days from the contract's start (`signed`, `+0x44`) until it
  expires. One without a condition never expires. Ben Schlicke's 17, signed on 3 July 2027 with 791, and Eli Junior
  Kroupi's 27, signed on 15 January 2027 with 960, both show "Expires on 1.9.2029"; Schlicke's 1 had one too. It is
  taken to hold for every release clause above. The app shows the day; it does not change a release clause's
  condition.
- **27** is shown as inactive while the player's own club plays in the Champions League.
- **55 and 56 are the active forms of 1 and 2.** At a season's end the game turns a relegated club's 1 into 55 and
  a club that was not promoted's 2 into 56, with the same amount: Lennart Winkler (SC Fortuna Köln) had 2 with
  161,288 until 18 March 2028 and 56 with 161,288 from 31 May 2028, shown in game as £160K (RootTourist, #81).
- **19** turns into the new wage once the player reaches the caps, and the clause is gone. On the VfB Stuttgart save
  (Windows Steam) it is on 100 to 155 contracts, always with 5: Castello Lukeba's 158,689 with 5 shows "£8.25M p/a,
  After 5 international appearances" (#81).
- **The game deletes expired release clauses:** none of nine exports over a season held one whose expiry had
  passed (#81).
- **A condition of 65,505** (Jon Moncayola's kind 0, signed on 31 July 2023) would expire in 2202. The app takes a
  release clause's condition past 20 years (7,305 days) as a mark, a clause that does not expire, and shows no date.
  What the game shows for it was not seen.
- **A release clause of 0** (kind 0, 62 times on the large save) is shown by the game as a release clause of 0.
  Whether the game takes a bid of nothing is not known.
- **Not shown in the game:** 54 (no values; 31 times: Füllkrug, J. Hofmann), 58 (a condition from 1,262 to 1,433;
  7 times: Demirbay, Zainutdinov, whose screen says "No Addons") and 63 (no values; 14 times: Sabitzer, Szczęsny).
  The app lists them as "Not shown in the game".
- **Bonuses for winning a competition** ("Winning the First Division", "Winning the UEFA Champions League") are not
  in this list. They are the contract's list at `+0x80` (32-byte entries: the competition's UID at `+0x14`, the amount
  at `+0x18`), which the app does not show yet. "Remaining Loyalty Bonus" is not in it either.

## Squad statuses (`+0x54`)

| Code | In game | Seen on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Star Player | Mbappé, Messi |
| 2 | Important Player | Rodri, Orsolini |
| 3 | Regular Starter | Vinícius Júnior |
| 4 | Squad Player | Frenkie de Jong, Christensen |
| 5 | Impact Sub | Cristiano Ronaldo |
| 7 | Fringe Player | Richarlison, Balde, Galeno |
| 9 | Emergency Backup | Okubo |
| 10 | Breakthrough Prospect | Rico Lewis |
| 11 | Future Prospect (the FM21 manual's "Hot Prospect") | Pol Fortuny |
| 13 | Youngster | Marli Salmon, Mathis Albert |
| 14 | B Team Regular | Iván Villar |
| 15 | First-Choice Goalkeeper | Joan García |
| 16 | Cup Goalkeeper | Areola |
| 17 | Domestic Cup Goalkeeper | Neuer |
| 20 | Backup | Szczęsny |
| 21 | Emergency Backup (goalkeepers) | Bürki |
| 22 | Surplus to Requirements | Josh Sargent |

6, 8, 12, 18 and 19 were not seen on either save; the game's manual also names a "Continental Cup Goalkeeper", which
may be one of them. 15, 16, 17, 20 and 21 are only goalkeepers'. A free agent has no contract. For a player on loan
the contract screen shows the clubs instead of the status. The app names every code above; its edit menu still offers
1 to 5 only.

## Kind of contract (`+0xC3`)

| Code | In game | Seen on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Part-Time Contract | Lucas Beltrán, Dominik Pelivan |
| 1 | Full-Time Contract | |
| 2 | Amateur Contract | |
| 3 | Youth Contract | |
| 4 | Non-Contract | Yussuf Poulsen, Shayon Harrison |
| 10 | Senior Minimum Salary Contract (MLS) | Heorhiy Berezovskyi |
| 11 | Senior Contract (MLS) | Mark McKenzie |

On a save of 31 May 2028 with 33,670 players: 23,506 full-time, 4,472 youth, 1,820 part-time, 1,043 amateur,
932 non-contract, 6 of 10 and 1 of 11. A non-contract player's wage and expiry show as n/a, and his value at
`player +0x234` reads 0. The MLS's "Designated Player Contract" is not this byte: Messi, Bürki, Sargent and Latte Lath
read 1, as a full-time contract.

## On the Mac

Read with the probe (`histogram 0xC3 --contract`, `histogram 0x54 --contract`, `clauses`) on the Mac Steam build
26340721 (Apple silicon), on the Arsenal save of 33,616 contracts. The contract is laid out as on Windows, so
`layout-macos.toml` names the kind of contract at `+0xC3` too.

- **Kinds of contract:** 21,759 full-time (Mbappé, Haaland), 8,110 youth (16 years old on average), 1,812 part-time
  (Lucas Beltrán, as on Windows), 1,176 amateur, 758 non-contract and one 11 (Mark McKenzie, as on Windows).
- **Squad statuses:** exactly the codes above, none of 6, 8, 12, 18 or 19. 15, 16, 17, 20 and 21 are goalkeepers'
  (Joan García 15; Robert Sánchez 16; Mamardashvili and Lunin 17; ter Stegen and Onana 20; Rulli 21); Balde is 7;
  Zambo Anguissa, Çalhanoğlu and Akanji are 22.
- **Clauses:** the kinds above, and two more. 19 is on 111 contracts (an amount like a weekly wage, from 116 to
  239,865: Soulé, Lukeba, Alex Scott), and 56 on two, with an amount (Charles Vernam 588,000, Mahamadou Dembélé
  116,930), named since from the Windows readings below. Moussa Sylla's 9 holds 2,147,579 and 7, as on Windows; Kane's 41 holds 214,757.
- **Release clauses that follow each other:** Nico Schlotterbeck (contract signed on 10 April 2026) has three
  release clauses for foreign clubs: 51,541,912 with 797 days, 51,541,912 with 1,162 and 42,951,596 with 1,527. The
  conditions are 365 days apart and, as expiry dates, fall on 15 June 2028, 2029 and 2030. How the game weighs
  several release clauses of one kind is not known. No player of the human club has a release clause with a
  condition, and a player the club has not scouted shows no contract details, so the expiry was not seen on a game
  screen on the Mac.
- **In the game** (Turkish UI): Cristhian Mosquera's 13 (78,000 a week after 40 league games) and Harry Kane's 41
  (214,757 after 40 league goals and assists in the season) show as the app words them.
